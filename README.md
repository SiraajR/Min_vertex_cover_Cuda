# Minimum Vertex Cover using CUDA

This project implements a parallel algorithm for solving the **Minimum Vertex Cover** problem using **CUDA** to leverage GPU acceleration. The implementation is optimized for performance and designed to handle large graphs efficiently.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Given an undirected graph **G = (V, E)**, a *vertex cover* is a subset of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the subset. The **Minimum Vertex Cover (MVC)** problem seeks the smallest such subset.

This project implements a heuristic, parallel solution using multiple CUDA kernels.

## 🚀 Features

- Graph input using adjacency list representation.
- CUDA-based parallel kernels for:
  - Initialization of candidate cover sets.
  - Neighbor checking and adjustment.
  - Conflict resolution via thread prioritization.
  - Iterative refinement and termination detection.
- Host-device coordination using unified memory and synchronization flags.
- Designed for scalable performance on large graphs.

## ⚙️ Build Instructions

Make sure you have the **CUDA toolkit** installed and `nvcc` available.

```bash
# Compile the graph generator
g++ graph_gen.cpp -o gen

# Generate a random graph and save it to a file
./gen graph_output.txt

# Compile the CUDA MVC implementation
nvcc -O2 -arch=sm_89 -o mvc min_vertx.cu
# You can also use: nvcc -O2 -o mvc min_vertx.cu (for default architecture)

# Run the MVC program with input and output file arguments
./mvc graph_output.txt output.txt
```
## 🧩 Data Structures

The algorithm uses several key arrays for parallel computation:

- **PMvc** (`int* PMvc`) — *Proposed Minimum Vertex Cover*:  
  A binary array indicating whether a vertex is proposed to be part of the cover set in the current iteration.  
  - `PMvc[i] = 1` means vertex `i` is being considered for inclusion.

- **Mvc** (`int* Mvc`) — *Final Vertex Cover*:  
  The actual cover set being constructed.  
  - `Mvc[i] = 1` means vertex `i` is included in the final cover.  
  - This array is updated across iterations based on `PMvc` and neighbor state.

- **Adj** (`int* Adj`) — *Adjacency Status*:  
  Marks whether all neighbors of a vertex are already covered.  
  - `Adj[i] = 1` means all neighbors of vertex `i` are already in the cover (safe).  
  - `Adj[i] = 0` means the vertex still has uncovered neighbors.

These arrays are updated iteratively by different CUDA kernels, enabling convergence to a valid cover set.

## 🔍 Key Kernels

- **kernel1**: Initializes the proposed vertex cover set (`PMvc`).
- **kernel2**: Checks each vertex’s neighbors and marks whether it's fully covered (`Adj`).
- **kernel3**: Adjusts the proposed and final cover sets based on coverage status.
- **kernel4**: Resolves conflicts and tie-breaking using thread ID priority logic.

## 🧠 Notes

- The termination condition is flagged using a host-visible variable (`*terminate`) that device threads update when changes are made.
- Edge cases like isolated nodes (nodes with degree 0) are correctly handled.
- This parallel approach performs best on large, sparse graphs due to reduced inter-thread contention.

## 📈 Performance Results

To evaluate the performance of the CUDA-based MVC solver, we ran tests on large-scale graphs with varying sizes.

### ✅ Benchmark 2

- **Number of Nodes:** 10,000,000  
- **Number of Edges:** 10,000,000  
- **Execution Time:** ~115 ms

The execution time depends not only on the number of nodes but also the edge density and the structure of the graph. The algorithm is designed to converge faster when a majority of nodes can quickly satisfy adjacency constraints.
